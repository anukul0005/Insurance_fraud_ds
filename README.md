The motive of this project is to detect auto insurance fraud through Modelling.
The challenge behind fraud detection in machine learning is that frauds are far less common as compared to legit insurance claims. 
The target is to detect if a claim application is fraudulent or not.
By building a model that can classify auto insurance fraud, we will be able to cut losses for the insurance company.

Conclusion through Project:

After our analysis we ended up selecting Random forest model because it was giving us  satisfacytory results.

We selected Random forest classifier model with accuracy of 77.54%.

Here our model predicts 3422 true positive cases out of 4349 positive cases and 165 true negative cases out of 277 cases. It predicts 927 false positive cases out of 4349 positive cases and 112 false negative cases out of 277 cases. It gives the f1 score of 24.10%.

According to statistical analysis a bussiness can identify patterns from this model that the claim is true or false.

Further this model can be improved by hyper tunning and using various other balancing techniques and K-means clustering as well, which will help in more detaitailed analysis.
